<b>Task 1</b>
An eCommerce shop sells a variety of items weighing from 0.1 kg to 3 kg each. </br></br>
The shipping company that the shop uses charges them based on the boxes that can handle a max of 2 Kg. If the single item is more than 2 kg its counted as its own package and charged as a separate package.</br></br>

The task is to write a function which would take the input as weights of different items being shipped and the function will arrange them in the best possible way so that the shipping is charged minimum.</br></br>

There can be any number of items in an order but lets limit it to 20 max.

</br></br></br>
<b>Task 2</b>
There are two boats A and B. Both boats can take any number of people and weight. Write a program that will take as weights as the input and that distributes the weights in the two boats to the best possible equal arrangement.</br></br>
Write a program that will take the input as weights and provide the distribution of weights in two boats.</br></br>

P.S. The number of people on each boat doesn't have to be similar or equal, it's the weight that matters.

</br></br></br>
<b>Task 3</b>
There is a table named users with the following columns. Please create a table locally</br></br>
Create a program that will allow the user to upload a csv sheet and import the users info into the table. Some scenarios to handle.</br></br>
1. If the username or user_identification_id exists it should update the rest of the info from the sheet.</br></br>
2. If the username or user_identification_id does not exist it creates a new row.</br></br>
3. If it matches with username in one row and user_identification_id in another row, then it merges the data in one row and removes the other row.

</br></br>
Make sure the code handles sheets of 100k rows.
